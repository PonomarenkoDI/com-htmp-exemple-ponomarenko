<b style="font-style:oblique">L</b>orem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy<br> 
text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

<b style="font-style:oblique">I</b>t is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.<br>
The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using Content here, content here, making it look like<br>
readable English.

<b style="font-style:oblique">C</b>ontrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,<br>
 making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur,<br>
 from a Lorem Ipsum passage.
